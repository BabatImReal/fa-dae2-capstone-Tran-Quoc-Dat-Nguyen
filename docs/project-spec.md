### Project Overview
- **Working title**: AI Music Recommender Agent
- **One-sentence summary**: An AI agent that recommends songs by genre or tracks by artist, using a limited dataset or the Spotify API for real-time search and metadata enrichment.
- **Business/value objective**: Enable users to discover music tailored to their preferences, leveraging both curated datasets and live Spotify data for richer recommendations and insights.
- **Success metrics** (quantitative): Recommendation accuracy, user engagement rate, API response time, coverage of genres/artists.

### Problem & Scope
- **Problem statement and constraints**: Users need personalized music recommendations and artist/song information, but may be limited by dataset scope or require real-time data. Must handle both batch and streaming sources, and support flexible queries.
- **Personas/stakeholders and primary use cases**: Music listeners, playlist curators, researchers. Use cases: recommend a song by genre, find a track by artist, retrieve artist/song metadata (followers, tracks, albums, etc.).
- **In/out of scope**: In scope: recommendations, metadata lookup, batch and API integration. Out of scope: audio playback, user authentication, social features.

### Data Sources
- **Batch source(s)**: [Kaggle Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset), CSV, ~230k tracks, static snapshot (last updated 2023)
- **Streaming source(s)**: Spotify API (https://api.spotify.com/v1/), JSON, real-time queries, up to 20 requests/sec
- **Incremental strategy**: Use track/artist IDs and timestamps for deduplication and incremental updates

### High-Level Architecture
- **Diagram link or embed placeholder**: <!-- Add diagram here -->
- **Components**: 
  - Ingestion: batch (CSV), stream (API)
  - Storage: data warehouse for batch, cache for API results
  - Transform: dbt for batch data cleaning/enrichment
  - Orchestration: Airflow for scheduled jobs
  - Agent: AI recommender (tools/RAG)
- **Data flow**: 
  1. Data is ingested from batch sources (CSV dataset) and streaming sources (Spotify API).
  2. Raw data is stored in a data warehouse (batch) or cache (stream).
  3. Transformation processes (dbt) clean and enrich the data.
  4. Processed data is made available for analysis and querying.
  5. The AI agent accesses the processed data to generate recommendations or retrieve metadata.
  6. Results are returned to the user or downstream applications.
