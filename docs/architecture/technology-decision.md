## Decision: PostgreSQL for Local Development

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Approved

**Context**:  
We need a local database for development and staging of music data before sending to cloud. The database must handle JSON data from music APIs (Last.fm, Spotify) and support rapid development iterations. This addresses the "Where do we store it?" question for local development.

**Decision**:  
Use PostgreSQL in Docker containers for local development and staging.

**Rationale** (OLTP Pattern for Staging):  
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data integrity for music metadata (transactional)
- **JSON Support**: Native JSON/JSONB types for API responses
- **SQL Ecosystem**: Seamless integration with dbt and Python
- **Docker Ready**: Consistent environment across team
- **Production Similarity**: Skills transfer to cloud PostgreSQL services
- **Fast Transactions**: Perfect for staging and validation workflows

**Alternatives Considered**:  
- **SQLite**: Too limited for complex JSON operations and concurrent access
- **MySQL**: Weaker JSON support compared to PostgreSQL
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL complexity not needed for structured music data

**Consequences**:  
- ‚úÖ Fast local development and testing
- ‚úÖ Easy transition to cloud PostgreSQL
- ‚úÖ OLTP optimized for staging workflows
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires Docker knowledge
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional local resource usage

**Example**:  
Store raw Last.fm API responses in JSONB columns, then query with `->` operators for flexible data exploration during development.

## Decision: Snowflake for Cloud Data Warehouse

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Approved

**Context**:  
We need a cloud data warehouse that can handle large-scale music data, support ML workloads, and provide cost-effective scaling for our AI recommendation engine. This addresses the "Where do we store it?" question for production analytics.

**Decision**:  
Use Snowflake as our cloud data warehouse with separate RAW and ANALYTICS databases.

**Rationale** (OLAP Pattern for Analytics):  
- **Separation of Storage & Compute**: Pay only when processing data (cost-effective)
- **VARIANT Data Type**: Perfect for diverse music API responses
- **Auto-scaling**: Handles varying workloads (daily batch vs. real-time queries)
- **ML-Ready**: Built-in functions for recommendation algorithms
- **Time Travel**: Essential for data governance and debugging
- **OLAP Optimized**: Designed for analytical queries and aggregations

**Alternatives Considered**:  
- **BigQuery**: Google ecosystem lock-in concerns
- **Redshift**: More complex maintenance and scaling
- **Databricks**: Overkill for our use case, higher complexity

**Consequences**:  
- ‚úÖ Excellent performance for music analytics
- ‚úÖ Cost-effective with auto-scaling
- ‚úÖ Native JSON handling for APIs
- ‚úÖ OLAP optimized for BI and ML workloads
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Vendor-specific SQL extensions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Learning curve for Snowflake-specific features

**Example**:  
Load raw JSON from music APIs into RAW.MUSIC.TRACKS, then use dbt to transform into dimensional models in ANALYTICS.MUSIC schema.

## Decision: Python 3.10+ for Data Processing

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Approved

**Context**:  
We need a programming language for data collection, processing, and ML model development that can handle music APIs and integrate well with our data stack. This addresses the "How does it move?" and "How do we process it?" questions.

**Decision**:  
Use Python 3.10+ as our primary language for all data processing tasks.

**Rationale** (Ingestion & Transformation):  
- **Music API Ecosystem**: Rich libraries (spotipy, pylast, requests) for ingestion
- **Data Processing**: Mature tools (pandas, polars) for music metadata transformation
- **ML/AI Libraries**: Best-in-class ecosystem (scikit-learn, tensorflow) for recommendations
- **Async Support**: Concurrent API calls for better performance
- **Integration**: Native support for dbt, Airflow, Snowflake
- **ETL/ELT Support**: Perfect for both extract and transform phases

**Alternatives Considered**:  
- **Java**: Verbose for data processing, less ML ecosystem
- **R**: Strong for analytics but limited deployment options
- **Scala**: Learning curve too steep for team

**Consequences**:  
- ‚úÖ Fastest development for music data pipelines
- ‚úÖ Excellent ML/AI ecosystem
- ‚úÖ Strong community and documentation
- ‚úÖ Perfect for both ingestion and transformation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance limitations for very large datasets
- ‚ö†Ô∏è GIL limitations for CPU-intensive tasks

**Example**:  
Build async API collectors for Last.fm and Spotify, use pandas for data cleaning, and scikit-learn for recommendation algorithms.

## Decision: dbt for Data Transformation

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Approved

**Context**:  
We need a tool to transform raw music data into analytics-ready models with proper testing, documentation, and version control. This directly addresses the "How do we process it?" question in our ELT approach.

**Decision**:  
Use dbt (data build tool) for all data transformations in Snowflake.

**Rationale** (ELT Transformation Layer):  
- **SQL-First**: Leverages team's SQL knowledge for transformations
- **Testing Framework**: Built-in data quality tests
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated data lineage
- **Version Control**: Git-based workflow for transformation logic
- **Snowflake Integration**: Native support and optimization
- **ELT Pattern**: Perfect for transform-in-warehouse approach

**Alternatives Considered**:  
- **Python ETL**: More complex, harder to maintain, doesn't leverage warehouse
- **Stored Procedures**: Vendor-specific, limited version control
- **Airflow Tasks**: Mixing orchestration with transformation

**Consequences**:  
- ‚úÖ Clean separation of transformation logic
- ‚úÖ Excellent testing and documentation
- ‚úÖ Version-controlled transformations
- ‚úÖ Optimized for ELT pattern
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Another tool to learn and maintain
- ‚ö†Ô∏è SQL-only limitations for complex logic

**Example**:  
Create staging models to clean raw music data, then build dimensional models (dim_artists, dim_tracks) for analytics and ML features.

## Decision: Apache Airflow for Orchestration

**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Status**: Proposed

**Context**:  
We need to orchestrate our music data pipeline with scheduling, monitoring, and error handling across multiple systems (APIs, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, dbt). This addresses the "How does it move?" question for pipeline coordination.

**Decision**:  
Use Apache Airflow for pipeline orchestration and scheduling.

**Rationale** (Pipeline Orchestration):  
- **Python Native**: Fits with our Python-first approach
- **Rich Operators**: Built-in support for our tech stack (Snowflake, dbt, PostgreSQL)
- **Monitoring**: Web UI for pipeline visibility
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic and alerting
- **Industry Standard**: Widely adopted in data engineering
- **Workflow Management**: Perfect for complex ELT pipeline coordination

**Alternatives Considered**:  
- **Prefect**: Newer but less mature ecosystem
- **Dagster**: Complex for our use case
- **Cron Jobs**: Too simple, no monitoring or dependencies

**Consequences**:  
- ‚úÖ Professional pipeline orchestration
- ‚úÖ Excellent monitoring and alerting
- ‚úÖ Strong community and ecosystem
- ‚úÖ Perfect for coordinating ELT workflows
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Resource intensive (requires dedicated infrastructure)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex setup and maintenance

**Example**:  
Daily DAG that collects music data from APIs, loads to Snowflake, runs dbt transformations, and triggers ML model retraining.
